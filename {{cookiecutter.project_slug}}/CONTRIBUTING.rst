Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` for local development.

1. Fork the `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
    $ cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/
    $ make install-develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Try to use the naming scheme of prefixing your branch with ``gh-X`` where X is
   the associated issue, such as ``gh-3-fix-foo-bug``. And if you are not
   developing on your own fork, further prefix the branch with your Github
   username, like ``githubusername/gh-3-fix-foo-bug``.

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ make lint
    $ make test
    $ make test-all


6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the documentation in an appropriate place.
3. The pull request should work for Python {%- if cookiecutter.support_py2 == 'y' %}2.7, {%- endif %}3.4, 3.5 and 3.6, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/{{ cookiecutter.github_orgname }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    $ python -m pytest tests.test_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
    $ python -m pytest -k 'foo'

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bumpversion patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
